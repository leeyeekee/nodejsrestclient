This is a sample nodejs client to call a springboot backend rest api to list data and add data from and to a mysql database. 

This is deployable to OpenShift cluster.

It has a TARGET environment variable which needs to be set to the URL of a deployed springboot backend rest api service.

Reference to the springboot backend could be found @ https://github.com/leeyeekee/SpringbootOpenshitMysqlDemo.git.

Deployment steps:

1. Login to an OpenShift cluster. You can spin one up @ https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/.
2. Once login to the OpenShift cluster, create a sample project.
3. Add a mysql database to the sample project, database name : sampledb, username and password can set to any, e.g. admin/admin.
4. Add a springboot service using the git option pointing to https://github.com/leeyeekee/SpringbootOpenshitMysqlDemo.git, name the service eg. studentportal, 
remember to choose to create a deployment config.
5. While waiting for the springboot service to spin up, add 2 environment variables from secret to the studentportal service, DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD. 
Set these to point to the mysql service database_user and database_password respectively.
6. Add a nodejs service using this git option pointing to https://github.com/leeyeekee/nodejsrestclient.git, name the service e.g. studentfront.
7. Test the springboot backend service using the route. You should be able to retrieve a list of the students.
8. Copy the URL of the springboot backend service, add a environment variable i.e. TARGET to the nodejs service and set the value to the copied springboot backend 
service URL.
9. You should be able to load the nodejs client route, list the database records from the backend springboot service and create a record. The database record 
consists of an ID, name and address.
10. Stay tuned for a recording of this demo in due time.

Enjoy deploying to these to OpenShift.
