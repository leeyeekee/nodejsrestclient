This is a sample nodejs client to call a springboot backend rest api to list data and add data from and to a mysql database. 

This is deployable on an OpenShift 4 cluster.

Reference to the springboot backend could be found @ https://github.com/leeyeekee/SpringbootOpenshitMysqlDemo.git.

Deployment steps:

1. Login to an OpenShift cluster. You can spin one up @ https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/.
2. Once login to the OpenShift cluster, create a sample project.
3. Add a mysql database to the sample project, database name : sampledb, username and password can set to any, e.g. admin/admin.
4. Add a springboot service using the git option pointing to https://github.com/leeyeekee/SpringbootOpenshitMysqlDemo.git, name the service eg. studentportal, 
remember to choose to create a deployment config.
5. While waiting for the springboot service to spin up, add 2 environment variables from secret to the studentportal service, DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD. 
Set these to point to the mysql service database_user and database_password respectively.
6. Click on the springboot service route to ensure the springboot service is available. <serivce route>/students should return list of json records.
7. Use a rest api tool such as Postman, execute a post call to <serivce route>/add with the josn body such as {"id":"223","name":"MAMAM","address":"kaka"}, 
try a few times until you see that the post return with a success json entry correlating the json body. Refresh <serivce route>/students to ensure the newly
insert record appears in the json record list.
8. Add a nodejs service using this git option pointing to https://github.com/leeyeekee/nodejsrestclient.git, name the service e.g. studentfront.
9. You should be able to load the nodejs client route, list the database records from the backend springboot service and create a record.

Enjoy deploying these on OpenShift.
